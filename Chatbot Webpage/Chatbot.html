  <section id="tulips">
    <h2>Tulips</h2>
    <p>Tulips are known for their simple, elegant shape and vibrant colors. They bloom in spring and are often associated with renewal and the beginning of a new season. Their smooth petals and bright hues make them a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements worldwide.</p>
    <p>Tulips originated in Central Asia and were later cultivated extensively in the Ottoman Empire. In the 17th century, they became the center of "Tulip Mania" in the Netherlands, a period of intense economic speculation. This history makes tulips not only beautiful but also culturally significant.</p>

    <h2>Lilies</h2>
    <p>Lilies are elegant and fragrant flowers that symbolize purity and refined beauty. They are commonly used in weddings and religious ceremonies due to their classic white petals, though they also come in pink, orange, and yellow varieties. Their trumpet-shaped blooms make them stand out in any bouquet.</p>
    <p>Historically, lilies have held symbolic meanings in ancient Greek and Roman cultures, often associated with goddesses and the divine. Their image has been found in ancient art and mythology, solidifying their status as timeless symbols of purity and grace.</p>

  <section id="sunflowers">
    <h2>Sunflowers</h2>
    <p>Sunflowers are cheerful and bright flowers known for their large heads and yellow petals. They follow the sun’s movement throughout the day, a behavior known as heliotropism. Their seeds are not only edible but also used to produce sunflower oil.</p>
    <p>Native to the Americas, sunflowers were cultivated by Indigenous peoples long before European contact. They became a symbol of the sun and harvest and have been widely grown around the world for their beauty and utility.</p>
